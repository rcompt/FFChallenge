Data is not supplied as the data is confidential

Code here is used to only document the modeling procedures conducted

# Order of files
## pca_model.py 
should be run first to find the best number of principle components per target model

## scree-plots.py 
should be run next to further run analysis on each pca model, showing the cumulative variance explained within each model over the number of principle components

## individual_models.py 
is the last file to run as it performs cross validation to find the best generalizable model
